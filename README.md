## Impact of Health Spending on Health Outcomes ##

Empirical evidence has been inconclusive about the strength of the connection between health care spending and health outcomes. This paper uses the Health Nutrition and Population Statistics data from the World Bank to model the correlation between health expenditure percent of Gross National Income (GNI) and death rate, incidence of HIV, life expectancy at birth, malnutrition prevalence, mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes, or CRD, number of infant deaths, number of maternal deaths, number of people who are undernourished, and percent of the population that use at least basic sanitation services.
